# Complex Number Addition using Operator Overloading (C++)

This repository contains a C++ program that demonstrates **operator overloading** by adding two complex numbers using the `+` operator.

The program uses a class with private data members and a **friend function** to overload the addition operator.

---

## 📌 Program Overview
- Defines a `complex` class
- Uses constructors with default arguments
- Overloads the `+` operator using a friend function
- Displays the result in complex number format

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors
- Friend Functions
- Operator Overloading
- Encapsulation

---

## ➕ Operator Overloading
The `+` operator is overloaded to:
- Add real parts of two complex numbers
- Add imaginary parts of two complex numbers
- Return a new `complex` object

## 🧾 Sample Output
9+i11
